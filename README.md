# lifecycle-of-reactive-effects

In this read, I learnt:

- **an Effect has 2 lifecycles**:
  - 1. Syncronizing with an external system/network
  - 2. Stopping the synchronization with the external system
- _these is the only pair cycle (start synchronization & stop synchronization) to focus on when you're creating an Effect_
